# Hi there 👋, I'm @rep222

👀 I’m interested in web development, especially in front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Angular.  
🌱 I’m currently learning front-end development through a program at Algebra University, focusing on React and modern web design principles.  
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on beginner-friendly open-source projects related to web development and UI/UX improvement.

😄 Pronouns: He/Him  
⚡ Fun fact: I discovered my passion for coding by creating simple video games, and since then, I've been diving deeper into the world of front-end development.
